# Binary Search

- Create a program called `BinarySearch.java`
- Create a static method that implements binary search recursively and returns the index of the element you are searching for
- In the main method:
  - Read from the file `input.txt`
  - The first line is the number of elements the file contains
  - Read the remaining lines into an array (they are already sorted)
  - Prompt the user for a number
  - Use the binary search method you wrote to search the array for that number
    - Print the result
