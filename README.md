# Recursive Binary Search

## Due: DoW MM/DD at 11:59 PM

- Create a program called `BinarySearch.java`
- Create a static method that implements binary search recursively and returns the index of the element you are searching for
- In the main method:
  - Prompt the user to enter a filename containing the data to read in
  - Read from that file
  - The first line is the number of elements the file contains
  - Read the remaining lines into an array
  - Sort the array
  - Prompt the user for a value to search for
  - Use the binary search method you wrote to search the array for that number
    - Print the result of the call to the binary search method

Example Input:\
input1.txt\
19\
Example Output:\
5
